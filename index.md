In the past decade, the development of artificial intelligence and machine learning has been truly remarkable. There are several easy-to-follow posts that are created to explain the essential ideas of this project and inspire innovations:

- [Time Series Convolution](https://spatiotemporal-data.github.io/posts/ts_conv/). A convolutional kernel approach for reinforcing the modeling of time series trends and interpreting temporal patterns, allowing one to leverage Fourier transforms and learn sparse representations. The interpretable machine learning models such as sparse regression unlock opportunities to better capture the long-term changes and temporal patterns of real-world time series.

To advance the development of spatiotemporal data modeling in the research community, this project handles various spatiotemporal data:

- [Analyzing millions of taxi trips in the City of Chicago](https://spatiotemporal-data.github.io/Chicago-mobility/taxi-data/)
- [Constructing human mobility tensor on NYC rideshare trip data](https://spatiotemporal-data.github.io/NYC-mobility/rideshare/)
- [Utilizing international import and export trade data from WTO Stats](https://spatiotemporal-data.github.io/trade/import-export/)

To contribute to the open science, this project provides a series of tutorials for beginners to understand machine learning and data science, including

- Tensor decomposition for machine learning (see [the detailed page](https://sites.mit.edu/tensor4ml/) at MIT Sites):
  - Foundation of tensor computations
  - Foundation of optimization

- Spatiotemporal data visualization in Python:
  - [High-resolution sea surface temperature data](https://spatiotemporal-data.github.io/climate/sst/)
  - [Global water vapor patterns](https://spatiotemporal-data.github.io/climate/water-vapor/)
  - [Germany energy consumption](https://spatiotemporal-data.github.io/energy/E-usage-data/)
  - [Station-level USA temperature data](https://spatiotemporal-data.github.io/climate/daymet/)
  - Service-level mobile traffic data

For those who are interested in broad areas within the scope, we would like to recommend a series of [well-documented reading notes](https://spatiotemporal-data.github.io/bib/).
