- Intelligent & sustainable urban systems
- Optimization & decision making
- Data standardization & valorization
- Signal processing
- Network science
- Graph computing & learning
- Causal inference & learning
- Computational engineering
- Computational social science


In the past decade, the development of artificial intelligence and machine learning has been truly remarkable. There are several easy-to-follow posts that are created to explain the essential ideas of this project and inspire innovations:

ðŸŒ± [Time Series Convolution](https://spatiotemporal-data.github.io/posts/ts_conv/). A convolutional kernel approach for reinforcing the modeling of time series trends and interpreting temporal patterns, allowing one to leverage Fourier transforms and learn sparse representations. The interpretable machine learning models such as sparse regression unlock opportunities to better capture the long-term changes and temporal patterns of real-world time series. The content is mainly from our publications below:

  - Xinyu Chen, HanQin Cai, Fuqiang Liu, Jinhua Zhao (2025). [Correlating time series with interpretable convolutional kernels](https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2025.3550877). *IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering*. Early access.

ðŸŒ± [Time-Varying Autoregression](https://spatiotemporal-data.github.io/posts/time_varying_model/). Time-varying autoregression for discovering spatial and temporal patterns of dynamical systems. The system equation includes both time-varying autoregression on the data space and tensor decomposition on the latent space. The content is mainly from our publication below:
  - Xinyu Chen, Chengyuan Zhang, Xiaoxu Chen, Nicolas Saunier, Lijun Sun (2024). [Discovering dynamic patterns from spatiotemporal data with time-varying low-rank autoregression](https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2023.3294440). *IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering*. 36 (2): 504-517.


To advance the development of spatiotemporal data modeling in the research community, this project handles various spatiotemporal data:

- [Analyzing millions of taxi trips in the City of Chicago](https://spatiotemporal-data.github.io/Chicago-mobility/taxi-data/)
- [Constructing human mobility tensor on NYC rideshare trip data](https://spatiotemporal-data.github.io/NYC-mobility/rideshare/)
- [Utilizing international import and export trade data from WTO Stats](https://spatiotemporal-data.github.io/trade/import-export/)

To contribute to the open science, this project provides a series of tutorials for beginners to understand machine learning and data science, including

- Tensor decomposition for machine learning (see [the detailed page](https://sites.mit.edu/tensor4ml/) at MIT Sites):
  - Foundation of tensor computations
  - Foundation of optimization

- Spatiotemporal data visualization in Python:
  - [High-resolution sea surface temperature data](https://spatiotemporal-data.github.io/climate/sst/)
  - [Global water vapor patterns](https://spatiotemporal-data.github.io/climate/water-vapor/)
  - [Germany energy consumption](https://spatiotemporal-data.github.io/energy/E-usage-data/)
  - [Station-level USA temperature data](https://spatiotemporal-data.github.io/climate/daymet/)
  - Service-level mobile traffic data

For those who are interested in broad areas within the scope, we would like to recommend a series of [well-documented reading notes](https://spatiotemporal-data.github.io/bib/).
