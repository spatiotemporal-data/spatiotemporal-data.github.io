### Abstract

In spatiotemporal systems, large amounts of time seires data, such as urban mobility and climate variables, are readily available for implementing downstream machine learning tasks and supporting decision-making. Since these data are characterized by spatiotemporal dimensions and demonstrate data patterns of the system, it is important to reformulate time series problems with machine learning. In this talk, we introduce two scientific problems: 1) imputing missing values from partially observed time series data, and 2) quantifying time series perioditity in spatially- and time-varying systems. To solve the first problem, we present a time series convolution framework to perform efficient imputation on missing data, while maintaining scalability through fast Fourier transform. To solve the second problem, we highlight a mathematical framework based on sparse autoregression and mixed-integer programming to quantify the periodicity of multidimensional mobility data and climate variables.
