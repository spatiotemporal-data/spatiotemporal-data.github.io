In the past decades, we witnessed great development of time series models, especially on the univariate time series and multivariate time series. One most classical time series model would be the time series autoregression, including univariate autoregression and vector autoregression. However, almost all of these models are not well-suited to the multidimensional time series. In this post, we introduce a tensor autoregression for modeling multidimensional time series. Letâ€™s get started!
